== Introduction

*BrainTrain* is an open-source spaced repetition flashcard application which makes memorizing easy and efficient. Research has shown that the *Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is more effective* than traditional memorization techniques. With it, you will be able to *learn more with less time*.

*BrainTrain* is a desktop flashcard program and does not consume Internet bandwidth and can be used offline. It is also a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* program with none of the visual distractions Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications have. Furthermore, if you can type fast, you will spend *less time navigating the application and more time memorizing*.
