* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* Target User:
** Student who is trying to remember something content heavy for a given subject
** would like a flashcard system that introduces/tests them on words/ideas
** prefers command line interface for simplicity
** able to keep track of the progress of all lessons
